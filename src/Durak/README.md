Durak is a popular Russian card game. It is played with a minimum of 2 players, using only cards with values 6 and upwards. This is a Java rendition of the game with you pitted against the computer.

The aim of the game is to get rid of your cards. The game is played by rounds, where either you or the computer hit cards and the opponent tries to beat them. If one cannot beat them, he has to pick the all the cards on the table. After every round you refill your hand to six cards, unless you already have more than that.

Rounds proceed as follows. If for example it is your turn to hit, you press on a card that you wish the computer to beat. One can beat a card by a higher value card of the same suit or alternatively by using any high suit card, which is determined at the beginning of the game and appears on the right side of the window.

Now that there are two cards on the table you can add another one for the computer to beat or press the "End turn" button and let the computer hit a card for you to beat. To add another card to the table the card you select must be of the same value as any of the cards already laying on the table. The computer once again tries to beat the new card. If he doesn't have any cards that correspond he has to pick all the cards on the table, which will result in a new turn for you.

The same round rules apply to you when you are beating cards, that are chosen by the computer. After the deck runs out, you won't pick up anymore cards. The player who gets rid of his cards first wins.
